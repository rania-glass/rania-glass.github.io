                When I was a child, I wanted to be an inventor. There's a thrill in using the imagination to dream up things – all kinds of things – that still excites and inspires me. As I got older, I was drawn to architecture, costuming, and interior design. My imagination was captured by  beautiful spaces and displays, and I was inspired by the functionality of the pieces I saw.
                When I moved into my freshman dorm, my plans for the room weren't inspired by fairy lights or DIY art projects; they were driven by the goal of creating a space in which I could study and relax effectively. My decorative and organizational choices were based on research into how best to create that space. My freshman dorm was awesome because it was driven by design - I just didn't have the word for it yet.
            </h3>
             <h3 class="dark-text">
                At the end of freshman year, I changed my major to Computer Science. "This is where the inventors are," I thought. "These are the people building the future." Then, I saw what the designers do: It's the designers who envision the future, piece by piece, step by step, and who ask "How can we live better?" Brilliant inventions start with design. When I started to understand that, I realized that a designer is what I truly want to be.

                    as new elements are created and standards are updated.

                    As a team, we discussed what various interfaces could meet the needs described in the requirements. We discussed a mobile widget, a website, a mobile app,
                    a browser extension, a kiosk, a recurring email newsletter, and a print media campaign. This conversation involved evaluating the advantages of each with regards to
                    the design space. For example, an email newsletter provides more privacy to the end user than a kiosk does because of the setting in which these interfaces would be used.
                    A print media campaign is the most passive interface we could think of, but it has a higher initial cost and there are location restrictions on where the prints could be placed
                    that makes that interface uniquely challenging.

                    A well designed interface will make its affordances obvious to the user. To test this in our design, we plan to ask our volunteer what they believe they can do from within the interface
                    before they have begun to interact with it. To examine the initial use case, we will be recording how long the volunteer browses the newsletter before finding a story of interest
                    or closing the email. Should the user find that they are not interested in the story they select, we will be recording how many clicks and how long it takes them to return to the
                    newsletter. This allows us to evaluate error checking. The design should support learnability, and tasks should become easier with familiarity. To measure this, we will task the
                    volunteer to complete the same task twice and compare the amount of time required for both attempts.

                    comments, allowing the evaluators to take notes as insights are discovered during testing.
