                When I was a child, I wanted to be an inventor. There's a thrill in using the imagination to dream up things, all kinds of things, that still excites and inspires.

            As an older child, I was drawn to architecture, to costuming, and to interior design. My imagination was captured by the beautiful spaces and displays created;
                I was inspired by the functionality of the pieces I saw. When I moved into a dorm room my freshman year of college, my plans for the room weren't inspired by
                fairy lights and DIY art projects - they were driven by the goal of creating a space where I could study and relax effectively. My decorative and organizational
                choices followed from research into how best to create that space. My freshman dorm was awesome because it was driven by design, I just didn't have the word for it yet. </h3>

            <h3 class="dark-text">
            I changed my major at the end of that freshman year to computer science. This is where the inventors are, I thought. These are the people building the future.
                Then I saw what the designers do.
            It's the designers who envision the future, piece by piece, step by step. How can we live better? Brilliant solutions start with design.
            When I started to understand that, I realized that I want to be a designer.
